The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to\ncreate an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about\nhow much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational\nrisks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk\nand capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves\nappropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.\n\nThe New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital\nrequirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage\n(CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are\nSimple VaR if the collateral is eligible. If the collateral is ineligible then the Wholesale loan\napproach will be utilized or the collateral will be reduced to zero in the Simple VaR.\n.\nRoles and Responsibilities: Development, Testing and support.\nSoftware Used: Oracle 9i\n\nOTHER PROJECTS AND REAL TIME TRAINING:\n\nRTRM(Railway Ticketing System Through Mobile)\nA mobile based real time application with many exciting features like checking pnr status, train\navailability, trains between stations etc. This application was done in j2me and it uses weblogic\nas server and MSSQL as the database.\n\nUndergone a mandatory Training on Finance By Oracle Corporation\n\nEDUCATION\n\nBirla Institute Of Technology -  Pilani, Rajasthan\n\n2011\n\nBachelor of Technology in Computer Science\n\nUniversity College Of Engineering, University Of Kerala\n\n2005 to 2009\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nSKILL SET:\n\n\n\nLanguages: Core Java\nFront end\/GUI Tools programming: Adobe Flex, GWT\nDatabase: Oracle 10g\nIDE: Eclipse, FlexBuilder\nFrameWorks: Spring(Basics), MVC frame work\nOperating System: Windows, Linux, Unix","label":[[0,15,"Name"],[16,36,"Designation"],[39,52,"Companies worked at"],[53,67,"Location"],[465,485,"Designation"],[487,505,"Companies worked at"],[603,616,"Companies worked at"],[1238,1258,"Designation"],[1260,1278,"Companies worked at"],[1323,1328,"Graduation Year"],[2632,2652,"Designation"],[2654,2672,"Companies worked at"],[4410,4428,"Companies worked at"],[4441,4471,"College"],[4493,4498,"Graduation Year"],[4499,4541,"Degree"],[4543,4576,"College"],[4607,4612,"Graduation Year"],[4652,4850,"Skills"]],"Comments":[]}

WAAS Express provides the following benefits:\n- Bandwidth optimization\n- Application acceleration\n- Increase in remote user productivity\n- Interoperation with existing Cisco WAAS infrastructure\n- Network transparency\n- Deployment flexibility with on-demand service enablement\n- The Wexp is about the wide Area Application Service on IOS (Router) itself.\n- Mainly involves to checks the functionality of optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS,\nSMB and Config_sync.\n\nPRODUCT WAAS Express(Wide Area Application Services)\n\nPROJECT CISCO-WAAS\nCLIENT Cisco Systems\nORGANISATION HCL Technologies Ltd\n\nSoftware Engineer - Automation & Testing\n\n-\n\nJune 2011 to December 2012\n\n- Identified the automatable cases from the test plan.\n- Prepared the HLD document for the automatable cases.\n- Automated test cases for various components on the waas product for the functionality check.\n- Worked on Plaform, SNMP, SSL, HTTP component automation.\n- Automated around 600+ cases for various components.\n- Performed regression for all the automated cases through ATS framework with aetest script\ntemplate.\n- Active Participation in automating test cases for sanity test.\n- Reviewed the automated cases developed by team members.\n- Involved in executing all the automated cases and reporting bugs\/defects.\n- Worked on various releases of the products (Lancer, Phoenix, Skyhawk) for regressing the\nautomated cases and posted results in TIMS tool.\n- Defect filing in CDETS\n\nLANGUAGE TCL Programming, Python\nRELEASES LANCER, PHOENIX, SKYHAWK, SPRIT\nDESCRIPTION\n- Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) is a Cisco Systems technology that improves the\nperformance of applications on a wide area network (WAN). WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area\nFile Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at\nLAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based\napplications on a given network.\n- WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work\ntogether to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt\n\n\n\nto communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so\nthat they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server.\n- The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to\noptimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized\n- Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platform\ncheck.\n\nPRODUCT WAAS(Wide Area Application Services)\n\nEDUCATION\n\nB.E in CSE\n\nANNA University\n\n2011\n\nDay Adventist Matric Hr.Sec School\n\n2005 to 2007\n\nSKILLS\n\noptimization (2 years), Python (4 years), router (4 years), TCL (4 years), Testing (4 years)\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nTechnical Skills\nProgramming Languages Python, TCL, Power Query, SQL, Shell Scripting, C#\nConcepts Networking, WAAS (Wan Optimization), WAAS on Router, WAE(Wide Area Engine),\nWCCP Protocol,\nAutomation Framework ATS (Automated Test System), Selenium Testing Framework\nIDE(Integrated Development Environment) Eclipse, Pycharm, Pydev[Plugin for eclipse IDE]\nSoftware\nEclipse CDETS & Rally (Bug Tracking), eARMS (Regression testing), ACME(Versioning),\nTIMS(Reporting), HTMLTestRunner, Power Query(Automation), ARAS PLM(Product Lifecycle\nManagement), AML Studio (adaptive markup language)\n\nOperating Systems Windows XP\/10, Linux","label":[[0,25,"Name"],[26,39,"Designation"],[42,63,"Companies worked at"],[64,71,"Location"],[170,177,"Years of Experience"],[1136,1149,"Designation"],[1152,1173,"Companies worked at"],[1174,1187,"Companies worked at"],[1288,1301,"Designation"],[1304,1325,"Companies worked at"],[3481,3502,"Companies worked at"],[3503,3516,"Companies worked at"],[3651,3672,"Companies worked at"],[5560,5573,"Companies worked at"],[5629,5650,"Companies worked at"],[5659,5663,"Graduation Year"],[6598,6611,"Companies worked at"],[7652,7662,"Degree"],[7664,7680,"College"],[7681,7685,"Graduation Year"],[7687,7722,"College"],[7731,7735,"Graduation Year"],[7745,7837,"Skills"],[7880,8486,"Skills"]],"Comments":[]}

It is a proprietary platform and has company internal\ncustomers. It has main two planes, system management and system service planes and several\nsub modules.\nI have successfully worked on the following modules.\n\nModule - MML INI Parser Tool\nMML is Configuration Tool used in communication equipments\nThis Configuration Tool has set of default and user defined commands. INI Parsing tool is a tool\nwhich accepts MML Commands in certain grammar and generates Resource file and Binary File\nrespectively which will be read by server to resister the commands.\nInvolved in the development, testing, verification of the module on windows.\n\n\n\nModule - Man Machine Language\nMML is a configuration tool widely used in communication equipments. It uses Client\/Server\narchitecture. MML server communicates with both the client and the APP in the equipment.\nIt receives MML commands inputted by users from the client and relays it to APP to process\nit. After acquiring the processing result, the server generates a MML report and sends it back\nto the client. It interacts with other system modules. Connection Management, Authorization\nManagement, Command Process, Data Synchronization, Event Notification, Command Parsing,\nLOG\/ALARM Handling are some of the functions of MML Server.\nInvolved in the development, defect fixing and verification of the module on windows, Linux and\nvxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.\n\nModule - Configuration Management\nConfiguration Management Module is core module of System Management. Its main function\nis to define specifications for configuration management interface between the configuration\ntool layer and the application layer, and provide related configuration command communication\nmechanism. Any information that can be modified by the user\/application and that affects the\nfunctionality of the application can be regarded as configurable data. All configuration commands\ncan be sent to Configuration Management Module using a common interface type.\nConfiguration Data Management Module is a supplementary optional component that can be\nloaded to provide a persistent storage (&amp; retrieval) mechanism for applications' static\nconfiguration data.\nInvolved in the defect fixing and feature enhancement of the module on windows, Linux and\nvxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.\n\nModule - TL1\nTransaction Language 1 (TL1) is a widely used, \"legacy\", management protocol in\ntelecommunications. It is a cross-vendor, cross-technology man-machine language, and is\nwidely used to manage Synchronous Optical Networks (SONET) . It is defined for operation\nsystem\/ network element (machine-to-machine) interfaces. TL1 corresponds to the User System\nLanguage (USL), which is the language for human-to machine interactions. It is used for managing\nnetwork elements in a network. TL1 Module is an interface between an Application and Client.\nClient sends the TL1 Commands to perform some configuration operations in the Applications.\nTL1 module process the client text TL1 commands according to standard specification TL1 GR\n831 and interacts with the Configuration management module and Convert Response messages\nback to TL1 Response messages\nInvolved in development, verification and customer and release activities. I was a module lead\nfor this project.\n\nModule - QX\nThe Qx interface is a company proprietary application layer protocol between target and the GUI\nof NMS. By this protocol, NE can communicate with SCC (System Communication and Control)\nsoftware in different operation system. Each command has defined format. Commands are given\nin binary form.
